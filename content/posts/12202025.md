The Ultimate Scanpy Cheat Sheet for Single-Cell Analysis 🧬
Switching to hashtag#Python for single-cell analysis—or just need a clean refresher on the standard hashtag#Scanpy workflow?

I’ve condensed the core Scanpy pipeline into a single visual reference. From loading hashtag#10x data into hashtag#AnnData to QC, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and marker discovery—this captures the steps most analyses follow in practice.

📌 Key steps covered:
--Setup: Loading data and understanding the AnnData structure
--Quality Control: Computing metrics and filtering cells (including mitochondrial content)
--Preprocessing: Normalization, log transformation, and scaling
--Analysis: PCA, neighbor graph construction, UMAP, and clustering

This is designed as a quick-reference guide you can return to during real analysis sessions—not a tutorial, just the essentials in one place.

Save it for later 💾 or share it with someone getting started in Scanpy. ♻️
