🔥 **For years we relied on volcano plots, DESeq2, edgeR, and limma to understand how conditions differ.**

But large-scale single-cell and multiome datasets are revealing a simple truth:
✨ **What changes the most is not always what matters the most.**

Traditionally, Differential Expression (DE) asks:
➡️ *“Which genes show the biggest fold change?”*

Machine learning asks:
➡️ *“Which genes actually drive the biological difference?”*

And the answers are often completely different.


## 🔍 Where Machine Learning Takes Over

### 1️⃣ SHAP values
* Explain exactly how each gene contributes to a phenotype.
* Capture nonlinear interactions that DE completely misses.

### 2️⃣ Gene Programs > Single Genes
* Tools like **scVI, WGCNA, and SCENIC+** uncover coordinated gene modules.
* These predict identity, aging, and disease better than simple DEG lists.

### 3️⃣ Regulatory Networks
* Transcription factor activity and enhancer accessibility hold deeper signals.
* Small fold changes can lead to huge functional impacts.

### 4️⃣ Predictive Models
* Random Forests, XGBoost, and deep learning act as powerful classifiers.
* They detect subtle combination markers invisible to volcano plots.

## 🧠 The Core Shift

It comes down to a fundamental difference in the question being asked:

🟠 **Traditional DE asks:** What changed the most?
🟣 **Machine learning asks:** What *explains* the change?

These are not the same—and ML uncovers biology that classical DE cannot touch.

## 💡 Bottom Line

Differential expression isn’t “dead”… but it’s no longer the whole story.

The future of transcriptomics lies in:
🌐 Predictive modeling
💡 Explainable AI
🧬 Multiome integration (RNA + ATAC)
🔗 Regulatory networks
📊 Gene programs and latent factors

**📉 Volcano plots highlight what changed.**
**🤖 Machine learning explains why it changed.**
