Are you still relying solely on **scRNA-seq** to define cell states?

It's the default approach for good reasons—powerful, widely adopted, and biologically informative. It's not wrong. **But it is incomplete.**

If gene expression is the only lens you use, you're watching the biological movie after the most important plot points have already been set.

## 🔬 The scRNA-seq "Snapshot"

Single-cell RNA-seq excels at capturing the transcriptional output of a cell at a given moment. It allows us to identify functional shifts in cell populations.

**The Limitation:** Gene expression is typically a downstream readout—the end of a regulatory cascade, not the beginning.

## 🧬 The scATAC-seq "Preview"

Chromatin accessibility profiling shifts the question upstream. Rather than asking what genes are currently expressed, scATAC-seq asks what regulatory regions are open.

**The Limitation:** Accessibility does not guarantee transcription. It tells us *what could happen*, not necessarily what has happened.

## The Integration Rule of Thumb

* **scRNA-seq** shows what is *expressed*.
* **scATAC-seq** shows what is *possible*.
* **Together**, they reveal what is becoming *inevitable*.

If you rely on RNA alone, you're interpreting biology after the fact. The future of single-cell biology isn't about choosing between modalities. It's about integrating them.
